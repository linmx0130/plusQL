plusQL
======

plusQL, plus Q Library, is a set of widget extensions of Qt. The purpose 
that I built it is in order to learn how to build Qt widgets. So most of 
the source code files include lots of comments. It can be regarded as a set
of Qt examples. You can also use these special widgets in your software 
under the license in COPYING ( it is a BSD-style license).

Here is the list of the widgets plusQL includes:
 - pQLabelLineEdit - a widgets combined a QLabel and a QLineEdit
