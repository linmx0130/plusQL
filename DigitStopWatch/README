plusQL -> pQDigitStopWatch

pQDigitStopWatch is a simple widget that use QTimer to simulate a digit stop
watch. It recieve a QString as format string to show how much time has gone.
Here is an example:
	"<font size=6 color=\"red\"><b>%h%:%m%:%s%</b></font>"
This string will show a 6-size and red number stop watch. For the format 
string, "%h%" means that plusQL should show the hour's digits here. "%m%" 
stands for the minute's; "%s%" is for the seconds and "%ms%" is for the 
milliseconds. The interval is in milliseconds.

	public slots:
		void reset();
		void start(int );
		void stop();
		void setFormat(QString formatstring);
	signals:
		void timeout();
		void alarm();
	public:
		pQDigitStopWatch(QWidget *parent=0);
		bool isActive();
		int interval();
		void setInterval(int );
		QTime currentTime();
		void alarmAtTime(QTime);
	
* You can use alarmAtTime() to tell pQDigitStopWatch a time and then it will
emit signal alarm() to tell the program that it's time to do somgthing.
* Each time the numbers of stop watch changed, signal timeout() will be 
emitted.
