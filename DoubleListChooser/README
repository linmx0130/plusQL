plusQL -> pQDoubleListChooser

There are 2 QListWidgets in this widget. Users can easy to move items from 
one to the other one. It could be used in a dialog for mutiple choice.It is
also a good example for QListWidget. Because of my laziness, I made both the
QListWidgets and QPushButtons public. You can call their member functions 
in the way you like.

public:
	pQDoubleListChooser(QWidget *parent=0);
	QListWidget *LeftList, *RightList;
	QPushButton *toLeft,*toRight;
